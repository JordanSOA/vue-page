# About this project:

Personal project that I started to imagine after I graduated in web development. 

In order to keep learning, I want to build a simple web interface with the VueJs framework that I could not practice during my training or my internship.

Halfway between a portfolio and a CV, the prime purpose of this project is to expose information about my background, abilities, hobbies as well as achievements.

### Main challenges: 
	VueJS framework discovery
	Test-First methodology 
	Unit test with Jest
	Deployed with Heroku
